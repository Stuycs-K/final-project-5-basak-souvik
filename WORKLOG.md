Created all the class files.

### 2024-05-23

Wrote and tested the Hitbox class, which includes the collidesWith method. I also wrote parts of the LevelObject and its child classes, including displayImage, which works as intended. I also imported sprites for the basic block, normal spike, and short spike. The IDs in the sprite's name of the file are in accordance with the IDs of those blocks in Geometry Dash.

### 2024-05-24 to 2024-05-26

Wrote the functions for collideWithPlayer for some of the level object types. Also extracted a few hundred objects from Stereo Madness into the new class called StereoMadness. Wrote the drawMap and calculateCollisions in the Level class, and started writing the playFrame method in the Game class.
