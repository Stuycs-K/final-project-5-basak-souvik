Created all the class files.

Wrote and tested the Hitbox class, which includes the collidesWith method. I also wrote parts of the LevelObject and its child classes, including displayImage, which works as intended. I also imported sprites for the basic block, normal spike, and short spike. The IDs in the sprite's name of the file are in accordance with the IDs of those blocks in Geometry Dash.
