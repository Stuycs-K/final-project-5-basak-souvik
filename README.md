## Overview

In this project, I recreated Geometry Dash in Processing. This is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player has to jump and fly to avoid obstacles. I implemented two gamemodes: the cube and the ship, which jump/fly when the input is pressed. I also tried to make the hitboxes of the objects similar to those in the game. Every solid block, hazard, decoration block, etc. in the levels are their own objects. In order to make the levels, I used [this online tool](https://github.com/Folleach/GeometryDashAPI) to retrieve a list of all objects in a saved level in the actual game, write that list into a text file, and read that text file from this program.

## Instructions
The Sound library is the only library necessary to run this project. To run, run it on Processing.

Controls:
To select a level while in the menus, press 1, 2, or 3.

For the cube, press space or the up arrow to jump.

For the ship, hold space or the up arrow to fly.

Press p to pause, and e to exit the level while paused.

Press n to enable noclip.

## Bugs
Sometimes, the collision between the player and a jump pad doesn't register. Just use noclip when playing in case this happens.
